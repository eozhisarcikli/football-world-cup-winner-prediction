# Football World Cup Winner Prediction
Aim is to create a model which predicts the winner of the FIFA World Cup 2018.

Three datasets from kaggle were used:

1. FIFA rankings from 1993 to 2018 - used to get the FIFA ranking and points for the teams, which is a monthly changing rank previously shown as a decent predictor of team performance

2. International Soccer matches from 1872 to 2018 (courtesy of Mart JÃ¼risoo) - to find out how much the difference in point, ranks and the current rank of the team affects the outocme of a match

3. FIFA World Cup 2018 data set (courtesy of Nuggs) - to get the upcoming matches
